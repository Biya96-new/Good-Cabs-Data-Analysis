Project Overview:
Goodcabs, a cab service company established two years ago , has gained  a strong foothold in the Indian Market by focusing on tier-2 cities. With operations in 10 tier-2 cities across India, Goodcabs has set ambitious performance target for 2024 to drive growth and improve passenger satisfaction. As a part of this initiative, the Goodcabs management team aims to assess the company’s performance across the key metrics.

Key Insights:
•	426K trips were completed.
•	8 million kilometres were travelled.
•	Jaipur has the highest average fare per trip.
•	Cities like Surat and Vadodara have lower average fares.
•	Monthly revenue growth rate: 16.54%.

Tourism-Focused Cities (e.g., Jaipur, Mysore, Kochi):
1.	Cities like Jaipur and Mysore, known for their tourism appeal, have lower Repeat Passenger Rates (RPR%). Jaipur has an RPR% of 17.43%, while Mysore is at 11.23%.
2.	Tourists often visit these cities for one-off trips rather than for recurring travel, contributing to fewer repeat trips.
3.	These cities often show higher demand for weekend trips compared to weekdays.
4.	Tourism-focused cities show a smaller contribution to the pool of repeat passengers, as travellers may not revisit frequently.
Business-Focused Cities (e.g., Surat, Lucknow, Indore):
1.	Cities like Surat (42.63% RPR%) and Lucknow (37.12% RPR%) have a higher proportion of repeat passengers. This is likely due to frequent travel by business professionals
2.	These cities show higher weekday demand compared to weekends, reflecting the travel needs of professionals.
3.	Business-focused cities often have lower average fares per trip, as they cater to cost-conscious, frequent travelers.
4.	A larger share of trips comes from repeat passengers, indicating loyalty and frequent use of services in these cities.
Recommendation:
1.	Partnerships with event organizers to provide exclusive transportation deals can increase visibility and usage.
2.	Implementing surge pricing during high-demand periods (festivals or tourist seasons) can maximize revenue while ensuring availability for customers.
3.	Offering discounts during low-demand months (off-season) can attract locals and drive repeat business.
4.	Loyalty rewards for frequent travellers (e.g., tourists visiting multiple attractions) can boost brand affinity.

Additional Data to be Included for Deeper Analysis:
1.	Duration of trips and peak usage hours.
2.	Ideal time and trip acceptance/rejection rate.
3.	Compotator pricing strategies
4.	Passenger response to price changes at different times
5.	Analysing repeat booking patterns by customer demographics(age, gender, etc.)
