## Key Insights
### Business-Focused Cities (e.g., Surat, Lucknow, Coimbatore, Mysore, Vadodara)
-Surat has the highest repeat passenger rate (42.63%), indicating strong loyalty among business commuters.
-Lucknow follows closely with 37.12% RPR, showing repeat travel patterns, likely due to regular business routes.
-Trip volumes are high in Lucknow (~60K+) with consistent monthly demand—ideal for optimizing driver allocation.
-Coimbatore & Mysore show low trip volume and low RPR, suggesting these smaller business hubs may need marketing or service expansion.
-Vadodara has steady trips and moderate fare levels, maintaining a balance between affordability and usage.
### Tourism-Focused Cities (e.g., Jaipur, Kochi, Chandigarh, Visakhapatnam)
-Jaipur leads in total trips (77K), reflecting its popularity as a tourist hub, but has the lowest RPR (17.43%) – tourists are less likely to be repeat users.
-Kochi shows balanced performance in trips, ratings, and weekend demand – aligns with its seasonal tourism appeal.
-Chandigarh has steady trip numbers and weekend demand, making it an emerging hybrid city (business + leisure).
-Visakhapatnam has consistently low trips – potential for tourism campaigns or partnerships to drive demand.
-Weekend trip volumes are significantly higher in Jaipur, Kochi, and Chandigarh – ideal for targeted weekend promotions or tourist bundle offers.

## Recommendations:
- Focus on cities like Jaipur and Mysore with low repeat passenger rates by introducing loyalty programs and ride credits.
- Scale operations in Surat and Lucknow where repeat passenger rates are strong, ensuring more drivers and better service availability.
- Launch marketing campaigns in underperforming cities like Coimbatore, Visakhapatnam, and Mysore to increase awareness and usage.
- Align driver availability with demand patterns—e.g., boost weekend coverage in Jaipur, Kochi, and Chandigarh. 
- Leverage high weekend demand in tourist-heavy cities with special ride packages, discounts, and local partnerships.
- In business-focused cities like Vadodara and Lucknow, offer subscription models or ride bundles for daily commuters.
- Focus on service quality in cities with low ratings and low RPR by collecting rider feedback and providing driver training.
- Deploy seasonal campaigns and driver boosts in months with known spikes (e.g., Jaipur in Feb, Lucknow in April)
- Build customized action plans by city based on trip volume, repeat rate, fare, and demand timing instead of a one-size-fits-all approach.
